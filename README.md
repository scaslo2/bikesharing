# Bikesharing
## Overview:

Analyzing Citibike, bikeshare rides in New York City for the month of August, 2019. Using Python to format the raw dataset and Tableau to visualize the data. 

In this analysis, I focused on bike ride trends and user type. For user type, I analyzed both gender and account status: subscriber vs. customer. I made a Tableau story using 7 Tableau charts and graphs that I created. 


## Results

Short commutes - there is a clear trend in New Yorkers prefering to use Citi Bike for short commutes. Bike trips lasting 25 minutes or less, accounted for  well over 500,000 of all NYC Citi Bike trips in the month of August, 2019. As someone who spent the first 26 years of my life growing up in NYC, I can say that while New York City may have some of the best public transit, traveling on the Subway in the heat and humidity of August can be dreadful. Having access to a bicycle, offers a cool and refreshing alternative to the Subway. 

Trip counts & User type
On weekends there is more of a steady distribution throughout the day. With 9:00AM - 7:00PM being the bulk of the more popular times to ride a Citi Bike in NYC.
On weekdays, the majority of trips were during rush hour: 7:00AM - 9:00AM and 5:00PM - 7:00PM. It's fair to reason that Citi Bikes were used as an alternative vehicle for New Yorkers to commute to work. With that in mind, one could reason that Citi Bike is comparatively used more by locals than tourists. To add to this, when looking at the user type pie chart we see that 1.9 million - over 75% - of the Citi Bike users were subscribers. This would support the hypothesis that most of the Citi Bike users were locals, since it would be rational for locals to subscribe to a local service more so than a tourist would.

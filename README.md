# Bikesharing
## Overview:


Analyzing Citibike bikeshare rides in New York City for the month of August 2019 to highlight key trends in ridership. For my analysis I use Python to format the raw dataset and Tableau to visualize the data. The focus of my analysis was timing of bike rides and user type. For user type, I analyzed gender and account status: subscriber vs. customer. With my dataset I created a Tableau story using 7 Tableau charts and graphs.

## Results
__Total Number of Bike Rides by Minute__ - there is a clear trend in New Yorkers prefering to use Citi Bike for short commutes. Bike trips lasting 25 minutes or less, accounted for  well over 500,000 of all NYC Citi Bike trips for August 2019. As someone who spent most of my life growing up in NYC, I can say that while New York City may have some of the best public transit, traveling on the Subway in the heat and humidity of August can be dreadful. Having access to a bicycle, offers a cool and refreshing alternative, which may explain the large number of users in August.

__Hourly User Count by Day__
Looking at this heatmap, we can see clear trends throughout the week. On weekends there is an even distribution throughout the day. With 9:00AM - 7:00PM being the bulk of the more popular times to ride a Citi Bike. However on weekdays, the majority of trips were during rush hour: 7:00AM - 9:00AM and 5:00PM - 7:00PM. This brings up the question, are Citi Bikes are used as an alternative vehicle for New Yorkers to commute to work?

__Usertype__
Looking at the pie chart on usertype, we see that over two thirds of all customers are subscribers. This comes out to a total of 1.9 million, compared to roughly 500,000 non-subscriber customers. This may help answer the question on New Yorkers using Citi Bikes to commute to work. Logically, a subscriber would most likely be someone living in the area and when we combine this knowledge with the trend of Citi Bike users commuting during rush hour, we can assume that locals use Citi Bike as an alternative means of transportation to and from work.


__Gender Distribution__
When we begin to break down the distribution of user type by gender, we quickly see that males take up more than 50% of all users. In fact, males account for about 1.5 million of all users, which is more than double the number of users for female and unknown combined (roughly 750,000).

## Summary
Citi Bike is predominantly used by males. Being that subscribers account for more than half of all users, we can assume that locals use Citi Bikes the most. With this and our heatmaps we can deduce that local males commute to and from work using Citi Bike.
